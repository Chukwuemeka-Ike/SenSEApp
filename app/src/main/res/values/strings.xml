    <string name="home_greeting">Welcome to SenSE - a joint project by the Julius and Rensselaer High Frequency Integrated Circuits
        (RHFIC) Labs at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\n\n
        We are working toward an optimized life experience.\n\n\n
        The app is in the first stages of analyzing your circadian rhythm, which will eventually allow us build an ecosystem targeted
        at increasing overall wakefulness and cognitive alertness.\n\n\nTo do this, we analyze your heart rate from Fitbit and
        extract the circadian component. More information is available on the Visualization page

    <string name="circadian_health">The circadian rhythm plays a vital role in our overall well-being. From our sleep patterns and alertness,
        to our body temperature and metabolism, our circadian rhythm can have huge effects on how we feel.\n\n

        We\'re a group of researchers focused on improving our understanding of circadian dynamics with the hope of doing some good with that
        knowledge.

        The graph above shows your raw heart rate from Fitbit overlayed with the filtered output which we take to be your circadian rhythm.\n\n\n
        We get this output by isolating 3 harmonics from the heart rate, which allow us estimate how your rhythm progresses over the day.\n\n\n
        The algorithm is based on an Observer-Based-Filter that was developed by our lab.</string>
