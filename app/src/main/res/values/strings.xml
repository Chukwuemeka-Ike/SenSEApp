    <string name="home_greeting">Welcome to SenSE - a joint project by the Julius and Rensselaer High Frequency Integrated Circuits
        (RHFIC) Labs at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\n\n
        We are working toward an optimized life experience.\n\n\n
        The app is in the first stages of analyzing your circadian rhythm, which will eventually allow us build an ecosystem targeted
        at increasing overall wakefulness and cognitive alertness.\n\n\nTo do this, we analyze your heart rate from Fitbit and
        extract the circadian component. More information is available on the Visualization page
    </string>
    <string name="circadian_health">The circadian rhythm plays a vital role in our overall well-being. From our sleep patterns and alertness,
        to our body temperature and metabolism, our circadian rhythm can have huge effects on how we feel.\n\n
        Because of this, it\'s important that we can measure the rhythm and identify when issues arise. The
        SenSE app implements a filtering algorithm that tries to do this using your heart rate data.

        knowledge.

        The graph above shows your raw heart rate from Fitbit overlayed with the filtered output which we take to be your circadian rhythm.\n\n
        We get this output by isolating harmonics from the heart rate, which allow us estimate how your rhythm progresses over the day.\n\n
        The algorithm is based on the Observer-Based Filter that was developed by the Julius Lab. By combining linear control theory with gradient-free
        optimization, we\'re able to tune the filter to fit your data.\n\n
        We hope that as our research progresses, we will be able to combine these measurements with control algorithms that can help optimize your
        circadian dynamics - getting light at the right times, sleeping at the right times, etc.
