# SenSE App

Early development stage.

The SenSE app is an Android implementation of the observer-based filter (OBF) developed by the 
Julius Lab in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

The filter is able to process user biometric data and extract the underlying circadian signal, which
can be used in subsequent control attempts.

The long-term goals of the application are to create a pipeline for crowd-sourcing useful data
for our research, as well as test the underlying algorithm in diverse situations.
